# Welcome to Pywr’s documentation!

## What is pywr?
Pywr is a generalised network resource allocation for solving network resource allocation problems at discrete 
timesteps using a linear programming approach. It is written in Python and aims to be fast, free, and extendable. 
It has many similarities with other software packages such as WEAP, Wathnet, Aquator and MISER, but also has some
significant differences. Pywr’s principle design goals are that it is:

- Fast enough to handle large stochastic datasets and large numbers of scenarios and function evaluations required by advanced decision making methodologies;
- Free to use without restriction – licensed under the GNU General Public Licence;
- Extendable – uses the Python programming language to define complex operational rules and control model runs.
