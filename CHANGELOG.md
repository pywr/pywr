  - NaN checks are performed by default.
  - Added runtime option to use "unsafe" API with no error or NaN handling (see new documentation).
  - Added documentation describing error handling changes.

that users might reasonably expect to be applied. Now these models will error until a proper fix
is implemented. See issue #1001 to see details and track progress. (#1002)

## v1.15.2

### Bug Fixes

- Fix bug with `AggregatedParameter.remove()` and `AggregatedIndexParameter.remove()` methods using the
wrong method internally. (#997)

## v1.15.0

### New Features

- Performance improvements for the GLPK solvers. Several new options have been added to the GLPK solvers that
  reduce the number of linear programme updates required each time-step. These options are currently off by default,
  but can be enabled by either passing keyword arguments to the solver instances or via environment variables.
  (#912, #983, #985)
  - Update constant and fixed flows only once during reset (`PYWR_SOLVER_GLPK_FIXED_FLOWS_ONCE=True`)
  - Update constant and fixed costs only once during reset (`PYWR_SOLVER_GLPK_FIXED_COSTS_ONCE=True`)
  - Update constant and fixed aggregated node factors only once during reset (`PYWR_SOLVER_GLPK_FIXED_FACTORS_ONCE=True`)
- Improve memory usage in `DataFrameParameter` when running a subset of the defined scenarios. The parameter now only
  retains the data for the subset of scenarios required for the simulation instead of all scenarios. (#981)
- Update `MonthlyProfileParameter` and `RbfProfileParameter` to allow variable lower and upper bounds to be defined. (#986)

### Bug Fixes

- Fix use of deprecated `np.int` and `np.float` types. (#982)

## v1.14.0

## v1.11.0

### New Features

- Refactor node loading into two stages to solve circular loading problems. (#945)
- Add additional `get_all_xxx` methods to core nodes to allow fetching `min_flow`, `max_flow` and `cost`
values for all scenarios simultaneously. (#958)

### Miscellaneous

## v1.8.0

### New Features

- A change to the behaviour of Storage nodes with parameters for `max_volume`. Such nodes must
now have both `initial_volume` and `initial_volume_pc` specified. This allows using arbitrary parameters
for `max_volume` provided the initial condition is explicitly defined in absolute and percentage terms. (#690)
- Added `DelayNode` and `FlowDelayParameter` to allow emulation of time-of-travel. (#904)
- Added `DiscountFactorParameter`. (#901)
- Added support for optimising days of the year in `RbfProfileParameter`. (#908)
